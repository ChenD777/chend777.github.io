# Chen Dong — Academic Website (GitHub Pages)

This is a lightweight academic/research personal website (Home / About / Research / Publications / Contact) prepared for GitHub Pages.

## Quick deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository, e.g. `yourname.github.io` (recommended) or any repo name.
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repository root.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) / root
4. Wait for GitHub Pages to publish. Your URL will appear in the Pages settings.

## Customize
- Edit page content:
  - `index.html`, `about.html`, `research.html`, `publications.html`, `contact.html`
- Replace photo:
  - `assets/img/profile.jpg`
- Replace CV:
  - `assets/files/CV_Dong_Chen.pdf`
- Styling:
  - `assets/css/style.css`

## Notes
- The template is pure static HTML/CSS (no build step).
- External profile links are placeholders — update them in `contact.html`.
