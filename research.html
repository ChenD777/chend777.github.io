    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My research centers on <b>energy-efficient and safe operation of data center cooling systems</b>.
      I develop physics-informed learning models and advanced control methods that work under realistic system
      dynamics, uncertainties, and operational constraints.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 1: Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Modeling (Aug 2022 – Jun 2024)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Proposed <b>APCNNs</b> with improved prediction accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional PCNNs.</li>
      <li>Reduced short-term (15-min) forecast MAE by ~20% and multi-day errors by ~80% on real-world data center datasets.</li>
      <li>Established rigorous proofs to verify physical consistency across modeled processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project 2: Physics-Informed ML-Based Model Predictive Control (Jun 2024 – Oct 2025)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed an <b>APCNN-assisted MPC</b> controller with ~20% cooling-energy reduction under normal and unseen high-load conditions.</li>
      <li>Demonstrated consistently better energy efficiency with more accurate and stable temperature regulation than ML/time-series baselines.</li>
      <li>Extended to <b>physics-informed adaptive MPC (PIML-AMPC)</b>, achieving ~24% annual cooling-energy savings vs fixed-setpoint control.</li>
      <li>Improved deployment readiness by integrating learning-based prediction with physics-based knowledge for robust operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project 3: Deep Reinforcement Learning Control for Data Centers (Oct 2025 – Apr 2026)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Built an end-to-end DRL control platform for <b>hybrid-cooled data centers</b> with closed-loop training and evaluation.</li>
      <li>Implemented and benchmarked <b>SAC, TD3, and PPO</b>, achieving ~15% energy savings while maintaining stable thermal performance.</li>
      <li>Advanced <b>safe DRL</b> via constraint handling and violation monitoring to improve reliability under diverse conditions.</li>
    </ul>
