      <h2>Research</h2>

      <p>
        My research centers on <b>energy-efficient and safe operation of data center cooling systems</b>.
        I develop physics-informed learning models and advanced control methods that work under realistic system
        dynamics, uncertainties, and operational constraints.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Project 1: Hybrid machine learning-based prediction and intelligent control of data center thermal environment
        (Aug 2022 – Oct 2025)
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a <b>hybrid physics-informed machine learning framework</b> for data center thermal modeling,
          introducing <b>Adaptive Physically Consistent Neural Networks (APCNNs)</b> that achieve higher predictive
          accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional PCNNs.
        </li>

        <li>
          Achieved ~20% lower MAE for short-term (15-minute) thermal forecasting and up to ~80% error reduction
          over multi-day horizons on real-world data center operational datasets, while rigorously preserving
          physical consistency through theoretical analysis.
        </li>

        <li>
          Integrated APCNN-based prediction models into a
          <b>physics-informed machine learning–assisted model predictive control (MPC)</b> framework,
          enabling coordinated and adaptive optimization of data center cooling systems under both normal
          operation and previously unseen high-load conditions.
        </li>

        <li>
          Extended the control framework to a
          <b>long-horizon physics-informed adaptive MPC (PIML-AMPC)</b>,
          achieving approximately <b>20% cooling-energy reduction</b> in short-term evaluations and
          <b>~24% annual energy savings</b> compared with fixed-setpoint control strategies.
        </li>

        <li>
          Enhanced robustness and deployment readiness by tightly coupling learning-based prediction
          with first-principles physical knowledge, ensuring stable temperature regulation and reliable
          operation under realistic disturbances and operational variability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        Project 2: Safe and Energy-Efficient Control of Data Center Cooling Systems via Deep Reinforcement Learning
        (Oct 2025 – Dec 2026)
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Built an end-to-end DRL control platform for <b>hybrid-cooled data centers</b>
          with closed-loop training and evaluation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented and benchmarked <b>SAC, TD3, and PPO</b>, achieving ~15% energy savings
          while maintaining stable thermal performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advanced <b>safe DRL</b> via constraint handling and violation monitoring to improve
          reliability under diverse conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
